# Decision Matrix Task Prioritizer

A tool that simplifies task planning by breaking it into two intuitive steps:

1. **Low-level thinking**: Score individual tasks across different dimensions like urgency and difficulty
2. **High-level thinking**: Set dimension weights once to reflect your overall priorities

This separation helps you make better decisions by focusing on one thing at a time - first the details of each task, then your general priorities.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
